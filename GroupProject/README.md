# CanadaGroupProject
 The problem our team is hoping to solve is that Canada needs a user-friendly website that tracks COVID-19 cases in Canada from each region, maybe additionally adding introductory information about COVID-19 on the front-end.

 The people who care about this problem would be health organizations in Canada, as
 well as Canadians who want to be kept up to date. Our website will inform the public about any recent updates in COVID-19 cases in
 Canada from each region, as well as the number of fatalities, which will clearly solve the
 information problem.

 ● OurAPI is under development with the use of React and other various extensive
 applications to it, such as React Router. These are tools that are useful for the
 application of statistics. We would like to see different factors at play during the age of
 COVID-19. What statistical values can we gather given the local infrastructure of certain
 areas? How sociocultural phenomena have influenced certain areas and reflect
 fundamental changes in this sector of bias. how dangerous and infected an area might
 be, with underlying implications for the spread of COVID-19. It’s about understanding the
 highly concentrated areas and the rate of mutation under the influence of each given
 infection. The rate of each infection, the rapid expansion of infections within your area
 and other areas, and data analysis to avoid notions of correlation vs causation and much
 more as it remains a fundamental part of our problem during our time when data
 manipulation and misuse of statistical analysis is high.

 ● This use of front-end technology is representative in a way that relays the most
 fundamental importance of relying on information. With instances of front-end
 technologies, it became apparent and incredibly important with the idea of tackling data
 and the importance of being aware of and understanding the misrepresentations via
 front-end development and how the processes of it inform the general consensus of the
 public about COVID-19 data collection and allow others to be better informed about a
 particular decision to ensure the propensity of a certain characteristic that means the end
 goals. With libraries, it allows us to get ahead and be more attuned to organizational
 standards like React and so on, and how libraries can create something more in the
 scheme of being live-service and operative in a way that manages to all of us in a dark
 time by using confidence intervals, poisson, and distributive properties that we can
 understand more of within a field of ongoing research
