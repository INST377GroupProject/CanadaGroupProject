                <p>Welcome to a regional COVID-19 virus tracker. Our goal is to provide easy to read, easy to access statistics on COVID-19. The process is simple and easy, so after reading this, navigate to the "Tracker" page when you're ready. The map is interactive and should already be focused on Canada so you can begin searching for your region right away. After clicking on any selectable region, important statistics regarding the impact of COVID-19 there are shown. From there it is as simple as reading through the list and finding what you need. We told you it was simple.</p>
